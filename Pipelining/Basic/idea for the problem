    We consider the example at very simple stage pipeline
-4 n bit unsignd intgers a,b,c,d as inputs
-an n bit unsigned integer f as output

+follwing are carried out
-s1:x1=a=b x=c-d
-s2:x3 =x1+x2
-s3 f=x3*d


+points to note
-input d used in s1 as well as s3
-so the value of d must be forwarded to s2 and then to s3
